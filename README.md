## Overview

The Laptop Protection Trojan is a lightweight executable file that once launched would allow my laptop to act in a absurd way and would eventually cause it to shut down. The primary purpose of this Trojan is to add an extra layer of security to my laptop and protect it from unauthorized use.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to my local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/arpy8/laptop-protection-trojan.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd laptop-protection-trojan
   ```

3. To test the program just run it using:
   ```
   python trojan.py
   ```

   **Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. The program has been tested on Python 3.11, but it should work with other recent Python versions as well.**

## Usage

Once the Trojan is running, it will trigger the siren and will then continuously change tabs. Finally, it will proceed to lock the system, protecting my important files from the user.

**P.S.** Once launched, the only way to stop it is using the task manager (ctrl+shift+esc).
